# How to Request Changes

This guide explains how teachers can request changes to the school activities website without needing to know how to code.

## Creating a New Issue

When you need to make a change to the website, you create an "issue" on GitHub. Think of it as a request form that tells the system what you need.

### Step 1: Go to the Issues Page

1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Issues" tab at the top
3. Click the green "New Issue" button

### Step 2: Choose the Right Template

You'll see several templates to choose from. Pick the one that matches what you need:

#### 🆕 Add New Activity
Use this when you want to add a new extracurricular activity to the website.

**Example:** Adding "Photography Club" or "Volleyball Team"

**What you'll need to provide:**
- Activity name
- Description of what students will do
- Category (Sports, Arts, Academic, Community, or Technology)
- Schedule (which days and times)
- Maximum number of students

#### ✏️ Modify Activity Details
Use this when you need to update information for an existing activity.

**Example:** Changing Chess Club's meeting time or updating Soccer Team's description

**What you'll need to provide:**
- Which activity needs updating
- What needs to change
- The new information
- Why the change is needed

#### 🎨 UI Enhancement Request
Use this when you want to change how the website looks.

**Example:** "Make the buttons bigger" or "Use our school colors"

**What you'll need to provide:**
- What part of the website to change
- How it looks now
- How you want it to look
- Why the change is needed

#### 🐛 Bug Report
Use this when something on the website isn't working correctly.

**Example:** "When I click Register Student, nothing happens" or "The search box doesn't find activities"

**What you'll need to provide:**
- What went wrong
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- What you expected to happen instead
- How severe the problem is

#### ✨ Feature Request
Use this when you want to add completely new functionality to the website.

**Example:** "Add the ability to export student lists to Excel" or "Add a calendar view"

**What you'll need to provide:**
- Description of the new feature
- What problem it solves
- Who will use it
- How they would use it

### Step 3: Fill Out the Form

After selecting a template, you'll see a form with various fields. Fill in all the required fields (marked with a red asterisk *).

**Tips:**
- Be as specific as possible
- If you're not sure what to put in a field, write what you know
- You can always add more information in the comments later

### Step 4: Submit the Issue

1. Review your information
2. Click the green "Submit new issue" button
3. Your request is now in the system!

## What Happens Next?

Once you submit an issue:
1. GitHub Copilot (an AI coding assistant) or a developer will review your request
2. They'll make the necessary changes to the website
3. You'll get notifications when the work is complete
4. You can add comments to the issue if you need to provide more information

1. Choose the template that seems closest to what you need
2. Fill in what you can
